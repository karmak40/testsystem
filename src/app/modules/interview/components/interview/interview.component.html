			Practicing the basic interview questions is a good idea. Ask friends and family members to review the basic
			questions with you. You need to prepare for different interview situations such as a panel interview where you will
			be interviewed by several people instead of by just one person.

			You need to make sure you make contact with each person you are speaking to throughout the interview. It is
			important to feel comfortable in front of the group.

			If you are in a group interview where you and several other candidates are being interviewed at the same time, you
			should make sure that you volunteer answers for questions.

			It is important that you have a unique answer that applies to your job skills and that you are not just echoing
			someone elseâ€™s answers. This is a difficult interview because you need to be assertive without coming across as
			being aggressive or rude.

			In the interview you need a firm handshake, and make a personal connection with the person who is interviewing you.
			Make sure you highlight any experience you have that they specifically listed in the job description.

			Each answer should connect back to one of the strengths you can offer the company with an example of how you have
			done it in the past. This is essential in the interview; you are selling yourself to the company. This means that it
			is okay to highlight your strengths and talk about how they can benefit the company.
